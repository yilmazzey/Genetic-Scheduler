# Timetable with genetic algorithm (GA)


## Description

Improving the GA by applying the eugenics to optimize the running time and escape from local maxima in a non-convex optimization problem

**The progress of algorithm**

**Input**:

    [[Course ID, Teacher, The number of hour of class, Student class, Course name, The room type need to use]]

    [[Room, The room type]

*Each week is divided into 12 blocks (from monday to friday)*

*Each block is divided into 6 class period (both in the morning and afternoon)*


**Output**:

    [[Course ID, Teacher, Room, Block position in the week, The beginning point of class, The number of hour of class, Student class, Course name, Room type]]
